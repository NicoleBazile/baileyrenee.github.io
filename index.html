       <p class="bio">
          Born and raised by a powerful hard-working Haitian woman  in the city of Boston, Mass. I didn't have much growing up but I had what I needed. Though I experienced a few false starts on my dreams, I persevered and continue to strive for excellence. I currently work for one of the best financial institutes in the city of Boston. I have completed an amazing coding bootcamp with G|Code. I believe my future is bright.
